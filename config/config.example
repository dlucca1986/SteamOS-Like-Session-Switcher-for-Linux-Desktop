#              STEAM MACHINE DIY - CONFIGURATION GUIDE
# =============================================================================
# WELCOME! This is your control panel.
# The Launcher reads this file every time you start the SteamOS session.
#
# WHERE TO EDIT: 
# Modify the values in this file (~/.config/steamos-diy/config).
# If it's missing, the Launcher will auto-detect your hardware and create one.
#
# --- THE GOLDEN RULES (Read this or it WILL break!) ---
# CORRECT:  VARIABLE=value           (No spaces!)
# WRONG:    VARIABLE = value         (DO NOT put spaces around the '=')
# WRONG:    VARIABLE= value          (DO NOT put a space after the '=')
# WRONG:    VARIABLE =value          (DO NOT put a space before the '=')
# =============================================================================

# --- [ 1. SCREEN SIZE (Resolution) ] ---
# What is your TV or Monitor resolution?
# If left empty, the Launcher will try to guess (Auto-Detection).
# Common examples: 
# - 4K (Ultra HD): 3840x2160
# - 1080p (Full HD): 1920x1080
# - Steam Deck: 1280x800
TARGET_WIDTH=1920
TARGET_HEIGHT=1080

# --- [ 2. SMOOTHNESS (Refresh Rate) ] ---
# How many times per second the screen updates. Standard TV = 60.
REFRESH_RATE=60

# --- [ 3. ON/OFF SWITCHES ] ---
# Use 1 for YES (Enabled) or 0 for NO (Disabled).

# Show FPS counter and CPU/GPU usage while gaming? (Requires MangoHud)
ENABLE_MANGOAPP=1

# HDR (Deep Colors): Only use this if your TV supports HDR10.
ENABLE_HDR=0

# VRR (FreeSync/G-Sync): Use this only if your monitor supports it.
ENABLE_VRR=0

# --- [ 4. PRO SETTINGS (The "Magic Line") ] ---
# Add extra Gamescope commands inside the quotes.
#
# USEFUL EXAMPLES:
# - To use FSR (Better performance):  CUSTOM_ARGS="--upscaler fsr"
# - For Nvidia scaling (NIS):        CUSTOM_ARGS="--upscaler nis"
#
# INTEL UHD 620 NOTE: The values below are essential to prevent flickering.
CUSTOM_ARGS="--rt --disable-layers --disable-color-management"

# ! DANGER ZONE - WHAT IF THE SYSTEM CRASHES? !
# =============================================================================
# If you enter a wrong value and Steam fails to start:
#
# 1. WATCHDOG: The Launcher detects if the session lasts less than 3 seconds.
# 2. SAFE MODE: The Launcher automatically restarts itself with the 
#    '--safe-mode' flag.
# 3. RECOVERY: In Safe Mode, your custom 'config' file is COMPLETELY IGNORED.
#    The system will use emergency defaults to let you reach the UI
#    and fix your settings in this file.
# =============================================================================

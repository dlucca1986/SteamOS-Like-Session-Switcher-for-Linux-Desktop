> ### "Bringing the Seamless SteamOS Experience to any Linux Distribution (Arch-based)" 🚀

## 🌟 About the Project

Hi, I'm **Daniele**, and I’m a hardcore gaming fanatic! 🕹️

If you love the Steam Deck gaming experience as much as I do, you’re in the right place. I developed this project to faithfully simulate the **SteamOS ecosystem** on standard desktops and laptops, bringing that seamless "console-like" feeling to your Linux machine.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔄 Seamless Session Switching**:
* No more clunky menus! This enables the **"Switch to Desktop"** button directly from a standalone gamescope-session, just like on a real Steam Deck. It takes you straight to your KDE Desktop without stopping at the login screen.

  
* **🛡️ Clean & Safe Architecture**:
* I care about your OS! Instead of overwriting critical system files, I use a **"Master/Helper" structure** in `/usr/local/bin`. Everything is handled by transparent, easy-to-read **Bash scripts**, making it professional, safe, and keeping your system clutter-free.


* **🖱️ One-Click Return to Gaming Mode**: 
* I’ve included a handy desktop shortcut! You’ll find a **"Return to Gaming Mode"** icon right on your KDE desktop, so you can jump back into your library with just one click.


* **📦 Optimized for Arch-based Distros**: 
* Specifically tuned for the Arch ecosystem to ensure maximum compatibility and performance.

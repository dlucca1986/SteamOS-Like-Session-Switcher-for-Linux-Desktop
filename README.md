## 🌟 About the Project

Hi, I'm **Daniele**, and I’m a hardcore gaming fanatic! 🕹️

If you love the Steam Deck gaming experience as much as I do, you’re in the right place. I developed this project to faithfully simulate the **SteamOS ecosystem** on standard desktops and laptops, bringing that seamless "console-like" feeling to your Linux machine.

## 🚀 Quick Installation

To get started, copy and paste these commands into your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dlucca1986/SteamOS-Like-Session-Switcher-for-Linux-Desktop.git
cd SteamOS-Like-Session-Switcher-for-Linux-Desktop
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

- 💡 Note: The installer is interactive and will automatically verify your AMD hardware, install missing dependencies, and configure the necessary system permissions.

## 🛡️ Clean Architecture & Safety :

I value your system's integrity. This project is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible:

- No Overwriting: This project does not modify core system files; it uses /usr/local/bin and dedicated config directories.

- Transparent Sudoers: A minimal rule is added to /etc/sudoers.d/ only for the session-switching logic.

- Full Reversibility: Every change made by the installer can be undone using the uninstaller.

## 🗑️ Uninstallation
If you wish to revert all changes, I’ve included a dedicated uninstaller. 

It will completely remove all scripts, symbolic links, desktop shortcuts, and the sudoers rule:
```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

# SteamOS-Like-Session-Switcher-for-Linux-Desktop
This project provides a set of scripts to replicate the seamless session switching experience of the Steam Deck on a standard PC. It allows you to toggle between KDE Plasma (Desktop Mode) and Steam Big Picture/Gamescope (Game Mode) using SDDM.




What's inside ?


set-sddm-session: 
  The core logic.
  It writes a temporary configuration to /etc/sddm.conf.d/ to set the autologin session for the next boot and triggers a delayed restart of the Display Manager.


gamescope-session: 
  The Game Mode launcher.
  It starts Steam with -steamdeck parameters inside a Gamescope standalone session.


steamos-session-select:
  A quick wrapper to call the system session selector and return to Plasma.

os-session-select: 
  A simple wrapper script used by the Steam Deck UI to trigger the return to the desktop session.

steam.desktop: 
  The session entry file.
  It must be placed in /usr/share/wayland-sessions/ to allow SDDM to recognize and launch the Gamescope/Steam Deck UI session.


GameMode.desktop:
  A shortcut file that can be placed on your KDE Plasma desktop to switch to Gaming Mode with a single click.

## 🌟 About the Project

Hi, I'm **Daniele**, and I’m a hardcore gaming fanatic! 🕹️

If you love the Steam Deck gaming experience as much as I do, you’re in the right place. 

I developed this project to faithfully simulate the **SteamOS ecosystem** on standard desktops and laptops, bringing that seamless "console-like" feeling to your Linux machine.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔄 Seamless Session Switching**:
  Native support for the **"Switch to Desktop"** button. Transition between Gamescope and KDE Plasma without ever seeing a login screen or typing a password.

* **🎮 Pure Console Experience**:
  Powered by a custom Watchdog system. If a session fails to start, it automatically triggers a Safe Mode (720p/60Hz) fallback to prevent black screens.

* **📏 Hardware-Aware Scaling**: Automatically detects your monitor's limits to prevent "Out of Range" errors while allowing full customization via user config.

* **🔴 Performance Ready**:
  Integrated with **Feral GameMode** and **MangoHud** for real-time monitoring and maximum CPU priority.
  
* **🧹 Argument Scrubbing**: Automatically cleans conflicting flags from your custom arguments to ensure a stable standalone session.

## 🚀 Quick Installation

To get started, copy and paste these commands into your terminal:

```bash
Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/dlucca1986/SteamMachine-DIY.git`
Enter the folder:
   `cd SteamMachine-DIY`
Run the installer:
   `chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`
```

- 💡 Note: The installer is interactive and will automatically verify your AMD hardware, install missing dependencies, and configure the necessary system permissions.

## 🛡️ Clean Architecture & Safety :

I value your system's integrity. This project is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible:

- No Overwriting: This project does not modify core system files; it uses /usr/local/bin and dedicated config directories.

- Transparent Sudoers: A minimal rule is added to /etc/sudoers.d/ only for the session-switching logic.

- Full Reversibility: Every change made by the installer can be undone using the uninstaller.

## 🗑️ Uninstallation
If you wish to revert all changes, I’ve included a dedicated uninstaller. 

It will completely remove all scripts, symbolic links, desktop shortcuts, and the sudoers rule:
```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

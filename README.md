## 🌟 About the Project

Hi, I'm **Daniele**, and I’m a hardcore gaming fanatic! 🕹️

If you love the Steam Deck gaming experience as much as I do, you’re in the right place. I developed this project to faithfully simulate the **SteamOS ecosystem** on standard desktops and laptops, bringing that seamless "console-like" feeling to your Linux machine.

  Pre-configured for **1080p/120Hz** with **HDR** and **Adaptive Sync (VRR)** out of the box.

Clean Install/Uninstall: I value your system's integrity. The installer provides a dedicated uninstaller script that reverts every change, including sudoers rules and symbolic links.


## ⚠️ Mandatory Post-Installation Step

> "To achieve a seamless transition between Gaming Mode and Desktop, the session switcher requires permission to communicate with your Display Manager (SDDM) without a password prompt. Without this configuration, the 'Switch' command will fail. For security and stability, please follow the automated Sudoers setup."

* 👉 **Action Required**: [Follow the Sudoers Setup Guide here](https://github.com/dlucca1986/SteamOS-Like-Session-Switcher-for-Linux-Desktop/wiki/Sudoers-Setup)

## 🗑️ Uninstallation
To completely remove the switcher and all its configurations:
```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```
